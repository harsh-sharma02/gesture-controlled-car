# Gesture Controlled Robotic Car
This repository contains the source code and hardware circuit diagrams for the gesture controlled car I developed. This project uses Arduino, Accelerometer and nRF24L01 module to wirelessly transfer the gesture data from hand glove to the car.

## Hardware Setup
1. Connect the **ADXL345 accelerometer** and **nRF24L01 module** to the Arduino as shown in the circuit diagram.
2. Connect **DC motors** to motor driver.
3. Power the Arduino and motors using a suitable power supply.
4. Upload respective codes to the sender Arduino and the receiver Arduino.
